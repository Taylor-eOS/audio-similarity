This was a machine learning educational project that was abandoned before it ever ran. The goal was to analyze and segment audio into types of content. Many of the files do not work. Someone with an interest in this specific functionality might be able to get it to work, but the dual neural network setup (one classifying 30 second segments and determining a window for a second regression model to make exact predictions) is overly convoluted and was impossible to bugfix, so I switched to [another architecture](https://github.com/Taylor-eOS/segment-classifier).
